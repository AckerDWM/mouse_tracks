# mouse_tracks

This repo contains code to track the trajectories of rodents in videos of open field tests. The animals' positions are obtained by distance filtering, and trajectories are smoothed by Kalman filtering.

The Python notebook performs tracking on a sample video (hosted locally) of a mouse and generates a new video with the mouse's trajectory overlayed as a red path.
